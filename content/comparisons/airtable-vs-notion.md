**2. Feature Comparison**

### Database-based Structure

Airtable's core strength lies in its database-based structure, allowing users to create custom tables, forms, and views. This setup enables seamless data management and manipulation, making it ideal for tasks like project management, CRM, and inventory tracking.

Notion, on the other hand, uses a page-based structure, where users create notes and pages to organize their content. While Notion's flexibility is undeniable, its database capabilities are limited compared to Airtable.

### Task Management

Both platforms offer robust task management features, including Kanban boards, calendars, and to-do lists. However, Airtable's task management capabilities are more integrated with its database structure, making it easier to track progress and dependencies.

Notion's task management features are more geared towards individual tasks and projects, lacking the depth and complexity of Airtable's offerings.

### Kanban Boards

Both Airtable and Notion offer Kanban boards, a visual representation of tasks and workflows. Airtable's Kanban boards are deeply integrated with its database structure, allowing users to track progress and dependencies in real-time.

Notion's Kanban boards are more basic, but still effective for visualizing tasks and workflows.

### Notes and Pages

Notion's strength lies in its notes and pages feature, which allows users to create a vast array of content, from simple notes to complex databases. Airtable, on the other hand, lacks this feature, relying solely on its database-based structure.

### Collaboration

Both platforms offer real-time collaboration features, allowing multiple users to work together on tasks, databases, and notes. However, Airtable's collaboration features are more geared towards teams and businesses, with features like permission controls and audit trails.

Notion's collaboration features are more geared towards individual users, but still offer real-time commenting and @mentions.

### Mobile Apps

Both platforms offer mobile apps, allowing users to access their data and tasks on-the-go. Airtable's mobile app is more comprehensive, offering most of its core features, while Notion's mobile app is more limited.

### Integrations

Both platforms offer a wide range of integrations, but Airtable's 1,000+ integrations give it a significant edge. Notion's 500+ integrations are still impressive, but limited compared to Airtable's offerings.

### Pricing

Airtable's pricing starts at $12/user/month (billed annually), while Notion's pricing starts at $4/user/month (billed annually). While Notion's pricing is more competitive, Airtable's features and capabilities make it a more valuable investment for many users.
