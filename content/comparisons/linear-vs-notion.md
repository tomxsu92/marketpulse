**2. Feature Comparison**

### Task Management and Project Planning

Linear excels in task management and project planning, offering a simple, intuitive interface for creating and assigning tasks, setting deadlines, and tracking progress. Linear's focus on task management makes it an excellent choice for teams and individuals working on specific projects.

Notion, on the other hand, offers a more comprehensive set of features, including a database-like structure for organizing and linking notes, tasks, and other content. Notion's flexibility and customization options make it a versatile tool for various use cases, from personal note-taking to team collaboration.

### Note-taking and Knowledge Management

Notion's database-like structure and customizable templates make it an ideal tool for note-taking, knowledge management, and wiki-style documentation. Notion's flexibility allows users to create custom databases, templates, and pages to suit their specific needs.

Linear, while not designed specifically for note-taking, offers a simple note-taking feature for jotting down quick ideas and reminders.

### Database and Customization

Notion's database feature is a powerful tool for organizing and linking related content. Users can create custom databases, templates, and pages to suit their needs, making it an excellent choice for knowledge management, project management, and team collaboration.

Linear's focus on task management means it lacks a robust database feature, but users can still create custom lists and boards to organize tasks and projects.

### Integration and Collaboration

Both Linear and Notion offer integration with popular services, including Google Drive, Slack, and Trello. However, Notion's extensive library of integrations (over 500 third-party services) makes it a more versatile choice for teams and individuals working with multiple tools.

Notion's real-time commenting and @mention features facilitate seamless collaboration, while Linear's commenting feature is more basic.

### Mobile App

Both Linear and Notion offer mobile apps, allowing users to access and manage their workflows on-the-go.

### Customization and Themes

Notion's customizable layout and themes make it an excellent choice for users who want to tailor their workspace to their specific needs and preferences.

Linear's minimalistic design is clean and simple, but users have limited options for customizing the layout and theme.

**3. Pricing Face-Off**

| Plan | Linear | Notion |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Free | Limited features, 1 board, 1 list, 1 user | Limited features, 100 blocks, 1 user |
| Personal | $7/user/month (billed annually) | $4/user/month (billed annually) |
| Team | $15/user/month (billed annually) | $8/user/month (billed annually) |
| Enterprise | Custom pricing | Custom pricing |

Linear's pricing plan is more straightforward, with a clear distinction between personal and team plans. Notion's pricing plan is more complex, with a free plan and a "Personal" plan that offers more features than Linear's personal plan, but at a lower price.

**4. Who Should Choose Each**

### Linear

* Individuals and teams focused on task management and project planning
* Users who value a simple, intuitive interface
* Teams working on specific projects with limited scope

### Notion

If you're primarily focused on task management and project planning, Linear is an excellent choice. Its simple interface and robust features make it an ideal tool for teams and individuals working on specific projects.

If you're seeking a more versatile tool for note-taking, knowledge management, and team collaboration, Notion is the better choice. Its customizable layout, extensive integrations, and permission-based access make it an excellent choice for teams and individuals working on multiple projects.
