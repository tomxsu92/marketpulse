**Linear vs Figma: A Comprehensive Comparison**

When it comes to designing digital products, two popular tools stand out: Linear and Figma. Both are cloud-based design platforms that enable teams to create, collaborate, and iterate on user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) designs. In this comparison, we'll delve into the key features, pricing plans, and use cases for each tool to help you decide which one suits your needs.

### 1. At-a-Glance Comparison

| Feature | Linear | Figma |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Platform | Web, Mobile | Web, Mobile, Desktop |
| Design File Format | Linear format | Figma format, SVG, PNG, JPG |
| Collaboration | Real-time commenting, @mentions, file history | Real-time commenting, @mentions, file history, commenting on specific design elements |
| Version Control | Linear history | Figma history, branching, and merging |
| Prototyping | Limited interactive prototyping | Advanced interactive prototyping, animation, and effects |
| Integrations | Limited integrations | Wide range of integrations, including Google Drive, Slack, and Jira |
| Pricing | Free plan, $6/user/month (billed annually) | Free plan, $12/user/month (billed annually) |

### 2. Feature Comparison

**Design Features**

* **Linear**: Offers a clean, intuitive interface for designing digital products. It features a simple, drag-and-drop interface for creating wireframes, high-fidelity designs, and prototypes.
* **Figma**: Provides a more comprehensive set of design features, including a robust vector editor, advanced typography controls, and support for multiple design systems.

**Collaboration Features**

* **Linear**: Focuses on real-time commenting and @mentions for team collaboration. It also offers a file history feature to track changes.
* **Figma**: Takes collaboration to the next level with real-time commenting, @mentions, and file history. It also allows commenting on specific design elements, making it easier to provide feedback.

**Prototyping Features**

* **Linear**: Limits interactive prototyping, making it suitable for simple wireframes and low-fidelity prototypes.
* **Figma**: Offers advanced interactive prototyping, animation, and effects, making it ideal for creating high-fidelity prototypes and testing user experiences.

**Version Control Features**

* **Linear**: Uses a linear history system, which can make it challenging to manage complex design projects.
* **Figma**: Utilizes a robust version control system, including branching, merging, and a comprehensive history feature.

**Integrations**

* **Linear**: Offers limited integrations with third-party services, making it less suitable for teams that rely on multiple tools.
* **Figma**: Integrates with a wide range of services, including Google Drive, Slack, and Jira, making it a more versatile choice.

### 3. Pricing Face-Off

| Plan | Linear | Figma |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Free | Unlimited projects, 1 user | Unlimited projects, 1 user |
| Pro | $6/user/month (billed annually) | $12/user/month (billed annually) |
| Premium | Not available | $15/user/month (billed annually) |

Both Linear and Figma offer a free plan, making it easy to get started with each tool. However, Figma's free plan is limited to one user, whereas Linear's free plan allows unlimited users.

The Pro plan for Linear offers a competitive pricing point, with $6/user/month (billed annually). Figma's Pro plan costs $12/user/month (billed annually), which is twice the cost of Linear's Pro plan.

### 4. Who Should Choose Each

**Choose Linear if:**

* You're a solo designer or a small team with simple design needs.
* You prefer a clean, intuitive interface for designing digital products.
* You don't require advanced prototyping or version control features.

**Choose Figma if:**

* You're a team with complex design needs, requiring advanced collaboration and prototyping features.
* You need to integrate Figma with multiple third-party services.
* You're willing to pay a premium for advanced features and support.

### 5. Final Recommendation

If you're a solo designer or a small team with simple design needs, Linear is a great choice. Its clean interface and competitive pricing make it an attractive option for those who don't require advanced features.

However, if you're a team with complex design needs, Figma is the better choice. Its advanced collaboration and prototyping features, along with its wide range of integrations, make it an ideal tool for teams that require a comprehensive design platform.
