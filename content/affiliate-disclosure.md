## Affiliate Disclosure

**Last Updated**: January 2024

### Our Business Model

MarketPulse AI participates in affiliate marketing programs. We earn commissions when you purchase through our links.

### How It Works

- Cookies track referrals (30-90 days typically)
- You pay the same price
- We receive a commission from the vendor

### Editorial Independence

Our automated analysis operates independently:
- Rankings use objective metrics, not commission rates
- No paid placement
- Algorithmic content generation
- Full disclosure of all affiliate relationships

### Current Partners
